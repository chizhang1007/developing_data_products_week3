## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a web page presentation using R Markdown. The presentation should contain a plot created with Plotly. 

## Data

The data used in this project will be the "mtcars" dataset in R. The plot will show the correlation between horsepower (hp) and mile per gallon data (mpg).

## MPG vs HP

```{r plot, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~hp, y = ~mpg)
```

## Thank you!
